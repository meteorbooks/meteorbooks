My goal is to make reading accessible to everyday people.<br/><br/>
In the age of technology, no one wants to go the the store to buy a book, so we simply end up not reading.<br/>
But with Meteor, I'm hoping we will eventually have millions of free and paid books.<br/></br>
With my subscription service, instead of any physical $20 book, you will get the same book online, and 2.5 times cheaper.
